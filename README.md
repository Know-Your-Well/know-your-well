2022-2023 Nebraska Water Center Senior Design Capstone Project

## Executive Summary 

[Named Link](https://knowyourwell.unl.edu/ "Know Your Well") (KYW) is a project started at the University of Nebraska that engages high school students and teachers in sampling and testing groundwater quality. About 160 students from 19 schools participated in KYW Phase 1 from 2017 to 2019. A smaller project (Phase II) is underway involving 5 schools in the Bazile Groundwater Management Area in northeast Nebraska and is expected to finish in 2022. Through KYW, students are trained in well construction, features affecting well water quality, and how to collect and test samples. While sampling, students use Google Form Surveys (previously the KYW iOS App) to record well coordinates, land use, and other relevant features for up to 20 wells within 50 miles around their school, laying the groundwork for understanding groundwater vulnerability. Replacing the nonfunctional iOS app, a new KYW-III App will offer students a replacement mechanism to automate, manage and verify data collected by users. 

The long-term goal is to build a sustainable youth education well water program by extending the scope of previous KYW projects with an NRD-led program supported by the University of Nebraska Lincoln (UNL) and Kearney (UNK), involving up to 50 schools across Nebraska. Specific objectives are to:

*improve the website, strengthen links to NRD stakeholders, and develop an Android-based KYW-III App, 
*involve and train NRD staff in KYW-III program materials, and 
*recruit and engage up to 50 school groups in sampling and testing of local domestic wells, helping students relate results to land use, well construction, and hydrogeology.
